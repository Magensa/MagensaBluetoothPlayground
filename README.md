# Magensa Bluetooth Playground
Welcome to [Magensa Bluetooth Playground](https://btplayground.magensa.dev).  

This web app utilizes the library [```magensa-bluetooth```](https://www.npmjs.com/package/magensa-bluetooth).  
This web app was designed to exhibit the capabilities of the ```magensa-bluetooth``` library, and to serve as an example application on how to consume the library as well.  

In order to utilize anything ```magensa-bluetooth```, you will first need a compatible MagTek® device.  
Currently, the devices compatible are:  
- [eDynamo](https://www.magtek.com/product/edynamo)
- [tDynamo](https://www.magtek.com/product/tdynamo)
- [DynaPro Mini](https://www.magtek.com/product/dynapro-mini)  
 
If you would like to purchase a device, please head over to the [MagTek Store](https://shop.magtek.com/).  

To use your device in the playground, you can head over to the production deployment [here](https://btplayground.magensa.dev), or you can fork this repo and run it locally yourself.  

For complete API information, please see the ```magensa-bluetooth``` repo [here](https://github.com/Magensa/magensa-bluetooth).
